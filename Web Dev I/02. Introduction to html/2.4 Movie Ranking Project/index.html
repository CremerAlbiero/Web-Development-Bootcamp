<h1>The Best Films According to Raphael</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Films of All Time</h2>
<hr >

<p>
<h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
This is my favorite one. <br \>
<p>"The art is dark and suffocating,and makes the story extremely palpable. A particular tension can be felt throughout,and that really strengthens the impact the book has on us. Moreover the dialogues are minimalist thanks to Lloyd’s style; you don’t need many words to grasp a meaning or understand what is at stake. Also,the story would never have functioned so well without the power that Lloyd gives it; visually you get your money’s worth,as the comics are strong,crude and intense.In brief,if you’re still wondering,the ‘wow’ factor is indeed there in V for Vendetta."</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I really like this one, but as you may know, I can't talk about it.</p>
<h3>Back to The Future</h3>
<p>I can't even count how many times I've watched since I was a kid. It's one of the most funniest films in my opinion.
